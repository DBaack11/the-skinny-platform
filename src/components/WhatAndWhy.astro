      <h1>This is the business book, reinvented.</h1>
      <p>Maximum value in minimum time.</p>

      <p>
        We've all had a love-hate relationship with the standard business book
        - too much filler, not enough value. The Skinny™ is our reinvention
        of this established format, stripping away everything that doesn't add
        genuine impact. Skinny™ books are written to be read in under 60
        minutes, empowering you to read in one sitting without having to put
        the book down.
